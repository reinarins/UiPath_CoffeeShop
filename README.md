# UiPath Coffee Shop (Smart Caf√© Station)
An RPA project developed with UiPath Studio using State Machines, simulating a real coffee shop machine. The bot allows employees to log in with their ID, select products, insert payment, and receive a printed custom receipt.

# Objectives
- Practice and demonstrate the use of <b>State Machines</b> in UiPath Studio.
- Handle structured data: <b>Dictionaries</b>, <b>Excel reading</b>, <b>Input Dialogs</b>.
- Simulate a <b>real-world business use case</b>: a vending/ticketing system.
- Generate <b>custom receipts</b> with user's name, products, total payment details, and current date and time.

# Features
- Employee validation from Excel (ID + Name)
- Product selection via dynamic Input Dialog (menu generated from Dictionaries).
- Credit management: user can insert coins or bills (1‚Ç¨, 2‚Ç¨, 5‚Ç¨, 10‚Ç¨) until total is reached.
- If credit is insufficient, three options are displayed: a) Change products; b) Add more credit; c) Cancel order.
- Automatic change calculation
- <b>Custom receipt</b>: employee's name, selected items, total paid, change returned, current date and time.
